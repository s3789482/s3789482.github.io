									<strong>SitDown is a website that will show you how busy certain study areas are within RMIT</strong>
									<p><strong>Overview</strong><br>
									SitDown is a web application that assess the how congested certain common areas are within different building of the RMIT campus. A microcontroller will be placed in study areas that receive a high amount of foot traffic. Probe packages will be sent from WIFI enabled devices while trying connect to a WIFI network. These probe packages will be received via the microcontroller. On request, the application will push data to the user based on how close they are to an available seat. If no seats are available in that area the user will be able to give feedback on the prediction made by the application. 
									</p>
									<p><strong>Motivation</strong><br>
									During certain periods of the day, shared areas of RMIT can get extremely busy. The motivation for this project comes from walking around common study areas for 30 minutes trying to find an appropriate table and chair to study at. The city campus has 45,000+ people enrolled yet only 'approximately 2,200 seats'(<i>rmit.edu.au, independant study areas, nd, para 1)</i> designed for study, most tables that host 4 students will have 2 students sitting diagonally across from each other with their belongings sprawled across two seats, in turn, halving the number of available seats for other students.<br> This platform will inform new students to the university of places that they can sit and study without endlessly walking around. This application will increase productivity of students that want to study during their breaks at university.
									</p>
									<p><strong>Description</strong><br>
									SitDown will track foot traffic through out certain areas of the university. This will be done by placing a microcontroller in these areas, the microcontroller will scan for probe packets sent by WIFI enabled devices and send the number of devices found to a web application. In certain locations RSSI signal strength will be recorded as this is a good indicator to differentiate the data collector between individuals passing by or students that are seated at tables.
									<br>
									<br>
									The microcontroller is ‘catching’ probe packet sent by WIFI enabled devices. Probe packet contain lots of different information although we are just looking for MAC addresses as each device will only send one address at a given time. 
									<br>
									<br>
									MAC Addresses sent from devices will be randomised due the software updates from device manufactures. This will not affect the required data as we are looking for numbers of students in a specific area rather than knowing who that person is. Although knowing how long a specific student is in a certain area would be an ideal dataset to log as we could use that data to predict an average study duration.
									<br><br>
									We will need to make some assumptions during testing as most students carry multiple WIFI enabled devices which in turn will increase the number of probe packet being received. These constraints will be tested and coded into the program before the project is shipped.
									<br>
									<br>
									Since the wireless protocol is based on connecting the device to the strongest signal, probe packets will still be sent periodically by devices that are already connected to a network. RSSI strength (received signal strength indication) can be used to determine how close or far a device(transmitter) is from the microcontroller(receiver). This data will be logged in certain areas as a microcontroller may be placed near a busy foot traffic walkway that might affect the true count.
									<br><br>
									Once the application has the number of individuals within the range of the microcontroller the data will be pushed to a database where it can be reviewed. This data will be important as it will help development of the application predicting how many individuals are actually sitting down. Logged data will also show peak traffic times i.e 30 minutes past the hour when there’s more foot traffic as students are commuting to their next class.
									<br><br>
									The data then will be sent to a webpage that will display asynchronous updates to inform the user how busy the area is. A PHP script will be used with conditional arguments that will trigger elements to change different colours based on the congestion in that area. PHP will be used as it is a server side scripting language. i.e If a study area can hosts 100 students, 20 of those seats are tables with 4 seats we will assume half of them are being occupied, if RSSI is between -40 dBm to -100dBm the student is sitting at a table, else, the student is passing by etc...
									<br><br>
 									The script will perform these calculations and update the webpage accordingly. The script will push updates to the webpage every 60 seconds, this will give time for all microcontrollers to collect packets from different channels and send them to the server.
 									<br><br>
									This service will improve productivity throughout the uni while also providing the university valuable insights to how students move between university buildings.

									<p><strong>Tools and Technologies</strong><br>
									<ul>
										<li>Software</li>
										<ul>
											<li>Database: Oracle SQL modeling the data with Oracle SQL developer. MySQL may also be used as it is open source and has more freely available information online while debugging.</li>
											<li>Front End Development will be written in HTML, CSS and PHP. Bootstrap will be the framework used for layout. PHP scripts will be implemented to display asynchronous updates to the user.</li>
										</ul>
									</ul>
									<ul>
										<li>Hardware</li>
										This project can be conducted with any microcontroller that is WIFI enabled. Raspberry Pie is overkill as the CPU is to powerful for a project like this. I have most experience with Arduinos but I believe there is a cheaper microcontroller that can handle the load while drawing less mAh. The ESP8266 is a WIFI enabled microcontroller that would be ideal for a project like this. Running an open source firmware such as NodeMCU which is popular amongst IoT projects. 
									</ul>
									</p>

									<p><strong>Skills Required</strong>
									<br>
									<strong>Software</strong> 
									<ul>
										<li>The data received will need to sent to a server via the RMIT university WIFI network</li>
										<li>The data will need to be pushed to mySQL or Oracle database</li>
										<li>The server will need to push the information via a PHP script to the webpage</li>
										<li>Bootstrap framework will be used for the website layout, Bootstrap requires HTML and CSS code</li>
									</ul>
									<strong>Hardware</strong>
									<ul>
										<li>Coding the microcontroller will be done in an Arduino IDE</li>
										<li>NodeMCU requires code written in 'Lua' scripting language</li>
										<li>Microcontroller - ESP8266</li>
										<li>10,000 mAh Power bank, if the ESP8266 draws 80-90mAh while catching requests, this will give us roughly 4-5 days of testing</li>
										<li>Wires to connect the ESP8266 to the power bank</li>
									</ul>
									</p>
									<p><strong>Outcome</strong><br>
									A successful outcome of this project will be visualized by less overcrowding in common study area throughout the buildings at RMIT. The project will bring awareness to underutilised study areas and provide a good foundation for new students to find appropriate study area for the work they want to complete. This in turn will increase productivity in students that want to study while at university.
									This project will also provide valuable insights for RMIT clubs to promote themselves without spending more time than necessary finding a location to stand to hand out information/promote their club.
									The data gathered will help plan future renovations to RMIT infrastructure
