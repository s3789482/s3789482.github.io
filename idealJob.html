													<strong>What is your ideal job?</strong><p>Well that is a very difficult question to answer four weeks into my IT journey...but I'll give it a try!</p>
													<a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/38578812?searchrequesttoken=73dc6c60-ddf9-4a0b-8d7a-0c14fcc207e7&type=standard">Link to my ideal job</a>
													<p><br>This company is looking for Business Analyst to oversee an end to end implementation of Artificial Intelligence. This isn’t a technical role rather looking for someone that understands technology, humans and their relation. This role will be maintaining communication between internal and external stakeholders while motivating colleagues that are involved with certain projects.</p>
													<p>This position is appealing as it has a good mix of technology and human interaction. You need to understand and oversee implementation of new technologies while taking technical concepts and compiling them to plain English language, then relaying and explaining that information to people that have no understanding on the topic.</p>
													<p><strong>Employer </strong>Responsibilities, skills and qualifications for this position.<br>
													This role requires a people person to lead a team of technical business analysts. You will need to collaborate effectively between different departments within the company. You will need to produce documentation to support the implementation of the AI technology. You will also need to provide support in a fast paced, ever changing technology environment.</p>

													<ul>
														<li>Require 5+ years experience in a senior business analyst role, in a complex environment.</li>
														“Complex environment” is ambiguous, Considering googling the phase returns no definitive answer, I would assume they would like you to explain the complexity of environments you’ve been exposed to.
														<li>3+ years in AI implementation</li>
														I feel this requirement is negotiable. If you’ve been exposed to the full cycle of AI implementation I believe the time frame is redundant.
														<li>Strong stakeholder management and influence key stakeholder and teams.</li>
														<li>Ability to turn customer needs into detailed business requirements</li>
														<li>Operate in an ambiguous environment. Never a clear path to the end result</li>
													</ul>

													<p><strong>Personal </strong>Responsibilities, skills and qualifications you currently have
														<ul><strong>Qualifications</strong>
															<li>2 Years +  B2B direct sales</li>
															<li>2 Years + account management</li>
															<li>2 Years + Management of a team of 13 staff</li>
															<li>Diploma of IT </li> This diploma included a course on project management and working with internal and external stakeholders.
															<li>1 Year + Consultancy work within the hospitality industry
															4 Year + Running my own business.</li> 
														</ul>
														<ul><strong>Skills</strong>
															<li>Good understanding tailoring a product or service based solution to clients needs</li> This has been achieved through my consulting work. Although undertaken in a different industry, I believe the skills learned are highly transferable.
															<li>Operating within an ambiguous and dynamic environment</li>Throughout running my own business and management of a team of retail assistants.
														</ul>
													</p>
													<p><strong>Path to take to gain the skills for this role.</strong><br>
													This role requires one attribute university graduates can’t obtain for many years... extensive experience in the field. This role entails no direct education path… i.e If you want to be a lawyer, study Law. As I have experience consulting in unrelated fields, my first step would be getting an internship and/or entry level Business Analyst role within the hospitality industry, a role within an industry that I’ve been exposed to. This role will provide a good foundation to transition between industries. With this experience and a technology based degree I will look for a role within the technology industry. The key to getting this role will be building a network of business analyst professionals while also working on my soft skills.</p>
